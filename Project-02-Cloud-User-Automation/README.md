# Project 2: Cloud-Native User Automation with Microsoft Graph API

## Project Overview

This project simulates the complete lifecycle management of cloud-native users for a growing company. The primary goal was to automate the onboarding and offboarding processes using modern tools, ensuring efficiency, security, and scalability. All operations were performed using the **Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK**, which is the current industry standard, replacing legacy modules like MSOnline.

## Technologies Used

*   PowerShell 7
*   **Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK**
*   Microsoft Entra ID
*   Microsoft 365 E5 Licensing
*   Visual Studio Code

## 1. Automated Onboarding from a CSV File

I developed a PowerShell script (`Onboard-CloudUsers.ps1`) to ingest a list of new hires from a CSV file. The script performs the following actions for each user:
*   Connects to Microsoft Graph with the required `User.ReadWrite.All` permissions.
*   Programmatically finds the correct License SKU ID for the tenant's primary license.
*   Creates a new user account in Microsoft Entra ID with properties from the CSV.
*   Sets the user's mandatory "Usage Location" to enable license assignment.
*   Assigns a secure, temporary password and sets the "Force password change on next sign-in" flagâ€”a critical security best practice.
*   Assigns the correct license to the new user.

The script's output provides a real-time audit trail of created users and their temporary passwords.

The newly created users were immediately visible and correctly configured in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, fully licensed and ready for work.

## 2. Scalable and Secure Bulk Offboarding

To handle departing employees, a second script (`Bulk-Offboard-Users.ps1`) was developed to process a list of users from a CSV file. This script follows a secure offboarding workflow:
1.  **Immediate Sign-in Block:** The user's account is immediately disabled to prevent any further access.
2.  **License Reclamation:** The script first checks if the user has licenses, then removes all assigned licenses to free them up for new employees and ensure cost efficiency.
3.  **Robust Error Handling:** The entire process for each user is wrapped in a `try/catch` block, allowing the script to report an error for one user (e.g., a typo in the CSV) and continue processing the rest of the list.

## 3. Real-World Troubleshooting

During development, several real-world challenges were encountered and resolved:
*   **Incorrect License SKU:** The initial script failed because the hardcoded license SKU (`SPE_E5`) did not match the tenant's actual SKU. This was resolved by using `Get-MgSubscribedSku` to dynamically find the correct license part number.
*   **Missing PowerShell Modules:** The `Set-MgUserLicense` command failed because its specific module (`Microsoft.Graph.Users.Actions`) was not installed. This was resolved by identifying and installing the required module.
*   **Invalid Usage Location:** License assignments failed with a "BadRequest" error. I diagnosed this as a missing "Usage Location" property on the user accounts and updated the scripts to set this mandatory property before attempting to assign a license.
*   **Modern Graph SDK Syntax:** An error with the `Update-MgUser` command was traced to a syntax change in the modern SDK. The issue was resolved by using the correct `-BodyParameter` format to pass the account status.

## Summary of Skills Demonstrated

*   **Modern IT Automation:** Utilized the current-generation **Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK** to perform complex administrative tasks, demonstrating modern, best-practice scripting skills.
*   **Identity Lifecycle Management:** Managed the full user lifecycle from creation and licensing to secure offboarding and license reclamation.
*   **Advanced Troubleshooting:** Successfully diagnosed and resolved multiple real-world errors related to licensing, module dependencies, and mandatory user attributes.
*   **Robust Scripting:** Implemented security best practices (force password change on next sign-in) and robust features like error handling (`try/catch`) and pre-checks (verifying if a user has licenses before removal).
*   **Process Efficiency:** Created a scalable solution that can manage dozens of users in seconds, a massive improvement over manual GUI-based methods.
