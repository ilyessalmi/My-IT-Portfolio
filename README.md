## 👨‍💻 About Me

<img src="profile.jpg" align="right" width="150" style="border-radius: 50%;">

I am a resilient and technical IT professional with a unique dual background in **Cloud Infrastructure** and **Data Engineering**. 

My journey began with hands-on IT support in Prague, managing Microsoft 365 for a growing business. Seeking to deepen my technical capabilities, I completed an intensive **Data Engineer Bootcamp (RNCP Level 7)**, where I built end-to-end ETL pipelines using **Python** and **SQL**. I have now converged these skills to specialize as a **Cloud & Systems Administrator**.

I distinguish myself from other admins by using my data coding background to create **efficient automation scripts**, perform **robust troubleshooting**, and handle complex **log analysis**.

*   **Location:** Paris, France (Open to Remote/Hybrid)
*   **Languages:** English (Advanced), French (Native/Fluent), Arabic (Literary), Czech (Basic)
*   **Focus:** Azure IaaS, Intune, M365 Administration, IT Automation.
